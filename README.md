#### IPFS

Note the CID ```QmXHWfbbU3A3HrSuEM9HFS842Vi6r3FmkXgwv4TzgnjPR1``` targets one specific
release and will be outdated as soon as a new build of the site is published.


#### IPFS + ENS
http://blocktimer.dappstar.eth/

ENS name ```blocktimer.dappstar.eth``` is set up to point to the ipfs CID. The content hash
can be updated in the ENS system, so using this domain will always point to the latest release. 


#### IPFS + ENS + EthDNS
http://blocktimer.dappstar.eth.link/

If your browser does not have direct support for .eth domains you can use the ethDNS system
by simply adding ```.link``` to the ENS domain. The nameserver responsible for .link domains will automatically look up the according content hash
entry and return a gateway.ips.io link to the correct address.
